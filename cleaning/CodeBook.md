activityMeans.txt contains data merged and summarized from the original data set contained and described in the data/raw folder

activityMeans.txt contains the following columns:

"1" "subject" - indicates the test subject whose movement is being described
"2" "activity" - indicates the type of activity the detected movement represents

Activity being one of :

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The following columns contain the means of values indicated by the column/variable name for the given subject and activity type:
